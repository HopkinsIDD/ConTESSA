The metric of interest here is the percent of cases that are isolated among those not already detected through contact tracing - this includes people who may have been quarantined before they developed symptoms, or cases who were identified because you contacted them to notify them about their exposure to a case. The numerator consists of new cases first discovered by surveillance, excluding those who where already in quarantine or detected by interviews with contacts.
