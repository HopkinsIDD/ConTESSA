A household contact is defined as any contact that lives with the case. This includes residents who share the same room in a long-term healthcare facility and other similar settings. You should not include household contacts who have recently been infected (within the past 3 months) or who have been fully vaccinated, since per CDC guidance these contacts would not be required to quarantine. You may update this value using data from your contact tracing program, or use the application default. Two recent contact surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom found that, while under physical distancing directives, individuals reported on average 2.7 - 2.8 contacts per day, of which 1.6 - 1.8 occurred in the household.
