The infection fatality ratio (IFR) is the proportion of all people infected (not just those who have symptoms) who die, and will depend on:

*	The average age of the population   
* The prevalence of underlying comorbidities  
* Access to medical care

The best way to choose the IFR for your population is to use a measurement from your population and input that directly into this calculator. However, if you do not have access to an estimate, we provide some options here. The highest estimate is 1%, which comes from a modeling study of an older adult population. The 0.75% estimate is close to the estimate for France, where the average age is 41 years. A recent model suggests that the IFR from China was close to 0.5%, and the average age of their population is 37 years. If the average age of your population is in the 20s, the best IFR to choose might be 0.25%.
