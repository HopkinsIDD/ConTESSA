A case is another word for an infected person detected via surveillance. We want to know, among the cases with symptoms detected in the past four weeks, the average length of time (in days) between when someone exhibited symptoms and when they were tested for COVID-19 in your community. The date of symptom onset should be determined by the first day they reported having ANY symptom associated with their illness.
