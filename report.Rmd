*Report automatically generated from the [ConTESSA application](https://iddynamics.jhsph.edu/apps/connect/contessa/) on `r Sys.Date()`*

This report provides estimates of the effectiveness of a specified contact tracing program, based on key indicators for the timing and completeness of contact tracing.

### Program Assumptions

| Parameter                  | Value                    | 
|:---------------------------|:-------------------------|
| **Surveillance**           |                           |
| Percent of all symptomatic infections (not previously quarantined) that are isolated | `r glue("{round(p$rho_s*100, 1)}", "%")`     |
| Percent of all asymptomatic infections (not previously quarantined) that are isolated | `r glue("{round(p$rho_a*100, 1)}", "%")`     |
| Average number of days between symptom onset and isolation of a detected case | `r glue("{p$t_p}")`     |
| **Household Contact Tracing**            |                           |
| Percent of household contacts traced and quarantined | `r glue("{round(p$omega_h*100, 1)}", "%")`     |
| Average number of days between symptom onset of a symptomatic index case and household contacts notified and quarantined | `r glue("{p$t_qhs}")`     |
| **Community Contact Tracing**            |                           |
| Percent of community contacts traced and quarantined | `r glue("{round(p$omega_c*100, 1)}", "%")`     |
| Average number of days between symptom onset of a symptomatic index case and community contacts notified and quarantined | `r glue("{p$t_qcs}")`     |
| **Natural History and Transmission**  |                           |
| Basic reproductive number $R_0$                       | `r glue("{p$R}")`     |
| Percent asymptomatic     | `r glue("{round(p$alpha*100,1)}", "%")`     |
| Relative risk of transmission for an asymptomatic individual compared to a symptomatic individual |  `r glue("{round(p$kappa, 2)}")`     |
| Percent of all contacts that occur in the household |  `r glue("{round(p$eta*100, 1)}", "%")`     |
| Relative risk of infection for a household contact compared to a community contact |  `r glue("{p$nu}")`     |

*Note that Natural History assumptions can be modified in the "Advanced Options" module of the interactive application.*

### Effectiveness of Contact Tracing

```{r reductions}
  valA <- r_eff(input=p)
  redA <- (p$R - valA)/p$R
  percQ_A <- get_prop_identified(pqc(input=p))
  
```

**The contact tracing program following the assumptions listed above would be expected to reduce the reproductive number, $R$, from `r glue("{round(p$R,1)}")` to `r glue("{round(valA,1)}")`. This program is identifying `r glue("{round(percQ_A*100, 1)}", "%")` of infections in the community.**

### Technical Details

We developed a mathematical model to estimate the impact of test-trace-isolate programs on onward disease transmission. We consider transmission in discrete generations from individuals who have been captured in surveillance (V), effectively isolated or quarantined through test and trace efforts (Q), or who remain undetected in the community (C). We consider that, in each generation, some proportion of infections will be detected through a surveillance program. Onward transmission from those individuals ("index cases") is reduced by some factor, dependent on the timing from case identification to isolation and the assumed timing of infectiousness. The contacts of index cases are then able to be enumerated and potentially quarantined; similarly, onward transmission from infected contacts of index cases can be reduced, dependent on the time from index case identification and contact quarantine. We consider differences in the identification of asymptomatic and symptomatic index cases and quarantine of household and community contacts of index cases.

Full details of this model can be found here.  An interactive application implementing this model to explore the effectiveness of contact tracing programs can be found [here](https://lucy.shinyapps.io/test-trace-isolate/).
