Household contacts are defined as any contact that lives with the case. You may update this value using data from your contact tracing program, or use the application default. Two recent contact surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom found that, while under physical distancing directives, individuals reported on average 2.7 - 2.8 contacts per day, of which 1.6 - 1.8 occurred in the household.
