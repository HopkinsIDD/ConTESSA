Click on the tabs to see figures that will help you explore how improving the completeness or speed of your case detection, isolation and quarantine will increase the impact of your contact tracing program. The blue dot indicates where your program is currently performing. If you look along the line where the blue dot is, you can see what impact on the reproductive number you could expect if you improved the completeness or timeliness at each step, depending on the tab you have selected. The lines on each graph represent the change you could make by changing just that metric, holding all other metrics constant. If you want to see how your impact changes if you change multiple metrics at the same time, please explore using Scenario B.

By clicking on 'Scenario B' you have the option of selecting different values for multiple metrics to see how the reproductive number would change for comparison with your current scenario. This will add a green dot to your plot, identifying the reproductive number in this 'Scenario B' along with a line that demonstrates how the impact would change if you improved the completeness or timeliness for that metric, holding all of the other metrics in Scenario B constant. You can hover over the figure for more information.
