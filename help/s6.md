A case is another word for an infected person detected via surveillance. We want to know, among the cases with symptoms detected in the past four weeks, the average length of time (in days) between when someone exhibited symptoms and when they were asked to isolate. The yellow slider symbol here represents the number of days from symptom onset to being tested (as indicated in S5). Drag the **blue slider on the right** to update the number of days from symptom onset to isolation; this could be the same number of days or later than the answer in S5, but cannot be fewer days.
