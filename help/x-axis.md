This metric is the percent of cases that are isolated among those not already detected through contact tracing.   

* The numerator consists of new cases first discovered by surveillance, excluding those who where already in quarantine or detected by interviews with contacts (S4).  
* The denominator is based on your response to S2, the estimated number of infections in your community.
