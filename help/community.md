Community contacts are defined as any contact that does not live with the case. You should not include community contacts who have recently been infected (within the past 3 months) or who have been fully vaccinated, since per CDC guidance these contacts would not be required to quarantine. You may update this value using data from your contact tracing program, or use the application default. Two recent contact surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom found that, while under physical distancing directives, individuals reported on average 2.7 - 2.8 contacts per day, of which about 1 occurred outside of the household.
