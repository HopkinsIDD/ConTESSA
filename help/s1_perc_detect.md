We calculate percent detected as: 

(number of infections detected in the past week) / (number of infections in the past week)

(number of infections detected in the past month / 4.345)

and number of infections in the past week is estimated by:

(number of deaths in the past week) x (100 / IFR)

If you indicate that the number of deaths x (100 / IFR) is less than the total 
number of infections, we assume your detection is 100%.
